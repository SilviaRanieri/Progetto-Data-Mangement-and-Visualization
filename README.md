# Overview

Project of "Data Management and Data Visualization" courses consist in responding in the following question: "Is there a better time or airline to travel? Are there any differences between years?" 
We used data  from the website of the Department of Transport of the United States of America and in particular from the government agency "Bureau of Transportation Statistics" (BTS), it was possible to download the data relating to domestic American flights for the years 2018 and 2019, which were then supplemented with information from other sources. With regard to the latter, on the Kaggle platform it was possible to download datasets containing additional information regarding airlines and airports. Finally, from the website of the “Airports Council International - North America” (ACI), data relating to the number of passengers for some of the main airports over several years were obtained. Also, thanks to Python language and MongoDB.
Finally, the second part of the work shows some of the infographics, created using the Tableau Desktop software.
# Software

We use  Python for implementing the scripting  and Tableau Desktop for  the infographics.
